The job-submission*.py scripts in this subfolder make use of the [FabSim3](https://github.com/djgroen/FabSim3) and [QCG-PilotJob](https://github.com/vecma-project/QCG-PilotJob) packages. 
These libraries allow to execute the job on an external computer (e.g. a supercomputer) and retrieve the data on the local machine such that post-processing analysis can be done locally. 
We refer the interested user to the respective GitHub repositories for more info about installation and configuration of the packages and of the external machine.
